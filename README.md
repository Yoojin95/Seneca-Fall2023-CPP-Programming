# OOP345: Advanced C++ Language Workshops and Milestones - Fall 2023
This is a repository, which showcases my journey and accomplishments in the Advanced C++ Programming course taken during the Fall 2023 semester. 
This course was a pivotal step in my academic and professional development, significantly enhancing my understanding and application of object-oriented programming in C++. 
It also introduced me to the intricacies of multi-threaded programming, a skill essential for modern software development.

## Course Highlights
The curriculum was designed to deepen students' knowledge in several key areas of C++ programming, including:

#### Advanced Object-Oriented Programming
Building upon basic OOP concepts to explore advanced topics such as inheritance hierarchies and polymorphism. This allowed me to design more sophisticated and modular software systems.

#### Inheritance and Polymorphism Demonstrator
A project that involved designing a class hierarchy to demonstrate dynamic polymorphism and the use of virtual functions.

#### STL Container Application
Implementing an application that leverages various STL containers to solve a specific data manipulation task, showcasing the flexibility and efficiency of C++.

#### Multi-Threaded Programming
Gaining foundational knowledge in creating concurrent C++ applications. This involved understanding how to manage multiple threads to execute tasks in parallel, enhancing application performance and responsiveness.


## Personal Growth and Projects
Throughout the semester, I engaged in various projects and assignments that required the practical application of these concepts. 
These experiences not only tested my understanding but also challenged me to find innovative solutions to complex problems.
Through this hands-on approach, I developed a deeper appreciation for the power of C++ and its application in solving real-world challenges.
